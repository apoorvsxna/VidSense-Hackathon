{under development}

# Installation-

As this is under development (and not uploaded on the Chrome web store/Edge add-ons yet), you must sideload the extension to your browser. As of now, the extension has been tested on Edge but it should work on all Chromium-based browsers (i.e. Chrome, Edge, Brave and so on.)

To sideload, first, download the entire code as a zip and extract it. Next, go to the "Manage Extensions" page, and enable developer options. Now, click on "Load unpacked" and select the "extension" folder from the code you just extracted. The extension should now show up in the list of extensions and is ready to use.


# Usage-

1. Open the YouTube video based on which you would like to ask a question.
2. Open the extension.
3. Type in a question and click on "Generate Answer".
4. The answer would now be displayed in the answer text box.


# Working-

When the question is entered in the extension input box, it is sent to the backend python server via an http request along with the URL of the current tab
